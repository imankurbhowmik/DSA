// at any particular point of time no two function calls at the same level of recursison will be in the stack in the same time 
// only calls that are interlinked will be in the stack in the same time
// space complexity = height of tree (path)  O(N)  bcz these will be in the stackn the same time



// divide and conquer recurrences : use akkra bazzi to calculate time complexity
// linear recurrences
