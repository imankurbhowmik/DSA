// time complexity is a function that gives us the relationship about how time will grow as input grows

// considerations
// always look for worst time complexity
// always look for complexity for large infinite data
// even though value of actual time is diff they all grow linearly
// we dont care about actual time  ignore all constants
// always ignore less dominating terms


// big O notation 
// word definition :  O(N^3) : the relation cannnot exceed N^3
// mathematical part : 

// big omega notation
// opposite of bigO notation  bo(n^3) : atleast n^3 

// what if an algo has ub and lb as n^2 = O(n^2) & bo(n^2)
// theta notation

// little o notation : loosely upper bound strictly lower

// little omega notation : loosely lower bound strictly higher
